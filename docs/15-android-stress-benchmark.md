# 15. Android stress benchmark: compose-rs and Jetpack Compose under load

[12](12-android-performance.md) compares the two on a light social feed. This document compares them on two much heavier screens, built the same way in both apps (D400): a list of rich, heterogeneous items, and a screen running hundreds of animations at once. It measures jank, frame durations on both threads, work, memory and startup with the same tools as [12](12-android-performance.md) (D401).

**Short answer** (Pixel 8 Pro, Android 16; medians of 3 runs, startup of 15):

- **Scrolling the stress list**, neither app janks much: Compose missed 3 app deadlines in 3 runs, compose-rs 1 (a shader compiled on first use).
  - compose-rs's main thread is much shorter: p99 3.24 against 8.00 ms, and half the work.
  - Its RenderThread is slower: p50 3.04 against 2.60 ms. As on the feed, that comes from being boosted less, not from doing more work.
- **The stress animation** keeps both RenderThreads busy for most of a 120 Hz vsync (8.33 ms): Compose's frames exceed it at p90, compose-rs's at p99.
  - compose-rs had no janky frame in this session and Compose had 21 (20 of them in one slow run). In a second session, Compose had 2 and compose-rs 3.
  - compose-rs's frames are shorter on both threads.
  - Most of the RenderThread gap is one Compose default: a `graphicsLayer` whose alpha is below 1 draws offscreen (`CompositingStrategy.Auto`). compose-rs fades a layer holding a single drawing without one. With `CompositingStrategy.ModulateAlpha`, Compose's RenderThread matches compose-rs's and does less work.
- **Memory** goes the other way in the animation. compose-rs holds 405 MB after 13 s against Compose's 251 MB.
  - Its 50 waves are new paths every frame. Each frame's paths, and the masks the GPU cached for them, live until the garbage collector frees the Kotlin `Path`s.
  - On the list, compose-rs holds less: 98 against 111 MB after scrolling.
- **Startup** of the stress list: 126 against 143 ms.

## The screens

`examples/feed/src/stress.rs` (compose-rs) and `android/bench-compose/…/Stress.kt` (Kotlin Compose) are written widget for widget.

**`stress`** is a Material 3 `Scaffold` with a `TopAppBar` over a `LazyColumn` of 1,000 keyed items, with a sticky header ("Section n") before every 20. An item is one of four kinds, by its index modulo 4:

- **A carousel:** a title and an icon over a nested `LazyRow` of 12 keyed tiles. A tile is a 120 × 90 dp `Image` (`ContentScale.Crop`, rounded 12 dp clip) with a caption.
  - The images are 8 procedural 240 × 180 bitmaps: a diagonal gradient between two palette colors with lighter rings, computed by the same integer arithmetic on both sides.
  - They are made once, on first use.
- **A rich post:** an `ElevatedCard` holding:
  - a 44 dp circular avatar filled with a linear gradient, with a number;
  - the author, the time and a `MoreVert` icon;
  - an `AnnotatedString` of 4 lines at most, with bold, italic, colored medium-weight, underlined and highlighted (background) spans;
  - a row of 4 icons with counts.
- **An action card:** an `OutlinedCard` holding a title and an `AssistChip` with a leading icon, a `FilterChip` and a `SuggestionChip`. Below them, a determinate `LinearProgressIndicator`, then a `Button`, an `OutlinedButton` and a percentage.
- **A banner:** a 120 dp box with a 6 dp `shadow` and a rounded 16 dp clip, filled with a three-color linear gradient. A title and a line of text sit over it, and three icons in a corner.

Each item has several times a feed post's nodes. A carousel composes and lays out its own lazy list.

**`stress_animation`** is a `Scaffold` and `TopAppBar` over a column of five parts:

- **A ticker:** a text changing every frame ("Frame n · t ms"), written from a `withFrameMillis` loop and read in composition. It recomposes every frame.
- **A grid of 140 cells (10 × 14), each with its own infinite transition.**
  - Each cell animates a rotation (linear, restarting), a scale and an alpha (reversing), and a color, each with its own duration by index.
  - All four are read while drawing: `graphicsLayer { rotationZ; scaleX; scaleY; alpha }` and `drawBehind { drawRoundRect(color) }` (compose-rs: `graphics_layer` and `draw_behind`).
  - That makes 560 animated values.
- **Six bars** whose widths animate.
  - Each width is read while measuring (`Modifier.layout`), so it relayouts without recomposing.
  - Each bar has a percentage beside it, from `derivedStateOf`, which recomposes when the integer changes.
- **A card that grows to four lines and shrinks back to one every second.** It toggles from a `delay(1000)` loop, with `animateContentSize(tween(500))` on its column. This is a layout animation that moves what's below it.
- **A 140 dp `Canvas` of 50 sine waves**, each a 48-segment stroked path with its own amplitude, frequency and speed. The waves are recomputed from an infinite transition read while drawing.

The two apps' screenshots, side by side, match except for Material version details. These were compared at the top of the list, mid-scroll with a header stuck, and in the animation:

- Kotlin's `OutlinedButton` label is `onSurfaceVariant` where compose-rs's is `primary`.
- Kotlin's chip and card outlines are lighter.
- compose-rs's shadow is a blurred outline ([11](11-status.md)).
- compose-rs sits below the status bar, as on the feed.

## What differs, and why it's fair

D400 records the choices. A fresh reviewer checked the two implementations before measuring:

- **The same viewport.** Kotlin's list takes the scaffold's padding as a modifier (`Modifier.padding(padding)`), not as `contentPadding`. The edge-to-edge Kotlin app would otherwise compose, lay out and draw items under the bars, about 110 dp more of the list. A sticky header would also slide under the top bar. The feed in [12](12-android-performance.md) keeps `contentPadding`.
- **Compose's best practices.** These are what a skilled Compose developer writes:
  - keys on both lazy lists, and `contentType` on the outer one;
  - stable parameters, and `remember(index)` for the `AnnotatedString`;
  - deferred reads in `graphicsLayer { }`, `drawBehind`, `Modifier.layout` and `Canvas`;
  - `derivedStateOf` for the percentages, and one `Path` remembered and reset for each wave.
- **`contentType` is Compose's alone.** compose-rs has no item reuse ([11](11-status.md)): it composes each new item afresh, where Compose reuses the composition of an item of the same kind.
- **The progress indicator.** Kotlin's `LinearProgressIndicator` is given `gapSize = 0.dp` and an empty `drawStopIndicator`. That draws a track and a line, as compose-rs's does, rather than Material 3 1.4's two segments and stop dot.
- **The alpha of the grid's cells.** Kotlin keeps the default `CompositingStrategy.Auto`, under which HWUI draws a layer faded below 1 offscreen.
  - compose-rs fades a layer whose content is one drawing without an offscreen buffer (`setHasOverlappingRendering(false)`, D153 and D157).
  - `ModulateAlpha`, Compose's opt-in for the same thing, was measured separately (D402, "With `ModulateAlpha`" below).
- **Infinite transitions.** compose-rs runs one `Animatable` and one coroutine per animated value (`animate_value`). That makes 567 tasks a frame, and the ticker's. Compose runs one frame loop per transition (147) and ticks its animations together. This is a real cost of the library, measured as such.
- **Paths drawn anew each frame.** compose-rs's `Canvas` makes a new `Path` per wave per frame. There is no way to reuse one: a drawn path is a shared, immutable resource (`Arc<Path>`). So the display list defines 50 paths and drops 50 a frame, and the replayer makes an `android.graphics.Path` for each. Kotlin resets one `Path`. That is the bridge's cost, measured as such (see "Memory").
- **Clips and shadows.**
  - Compose makes a render node (a graphics layer) for each non-rectangular `clip` and each `shadow`, and HWUI draws the shadow from the elevation.
  - compose-rs clips inline in its drawing, and draws its approximate shadow with a `BlurMaskFilter`.
- **The theme.** Both apps use the light theme. The Kotlin app always does; compose-rs follows the system's, which was light.

## Method

measure.py's stress scenarios (D401), beside [12](12-android-performance.md)'s, which are unchanged:

- **`stress_startup`:** cold starts of `stress` (`am start -W`: `TotalTime`), `--runs` times, interleaved, and one traced start for the first frame's breakdown.
- **`stress_scroll`:** `scroll`'s method on `stress`. That is the memory 5 s after start, then a warm-up swipe left out, 10 flings 1.2 s apart, the memory after them, and 3 runs per app, interleaved.
- **`stress_animation`:** `animation`'s method on `stress_animation`: 10 s untouched, 3 s after start, 3 runs per app. Each run also records the memory before the trace (3 s after start) and after it (13 s).

`--scenarios stress_startup,stress_scroll,stress_animation` runs these alone; the report holds the scenarios run (`"scenarios"`), and `summarize.py` prints what's there.

The stress traces get a 384 MB buffer, against 64 MB for the feed's. HWUI traces every drawing operation of the animation's 140 layers, about 110,000 slices a second. A 64 MB ring buffer wrapped within 5 s and lost the process table scanned at the start, and with it every frame.

Every traced run now also lists its 5 slowest `doFrame`s and `DrawFrame`s, with the 8 longest slices inside each (`slowest_frames`). That is where the analysis below starts.

That tracing (atrace's `gfx` category) costs both RenderThreads time. On these screens it costs more than on the feed, so the RenderThread's durations here are traced durations; both apps pay it.

## Results

compose-rs at 921db6b with D400–D402. The run is `results/2026-10-23-pixel-8-pro-stress.json`: `speed`, `--runs 15`, the stress scenarios only. That is before D390, compose-rs's own performance hint session for the RenderThread ([12](12-android-performance.md), "Scrolling: the RenderThread's boost"), whose effect on these screens hasn't been measured: the RenderThread boosts below are HWUI's session's alone.

- measure.py's checks passed: the installed native libraries were those built, and both apps were `speed` at the start and the end.
- Medians of 3 runs, startup of 15. The better side is in bold; ties aren't.
- "Frames presented at another vsync than expected" counts frames shown later than FrameTimeline predicted. In the animation, most of both apps' frames are, because the main thread and the RenderThread together take longer than a vsync. They are presented a vsync late but on cadence: latency, not dropped frames. gfxinfo's 15 ms median frame time for both apps says the same.

### Stress scroll: frames (10 flings, 3 runs)

| | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Frames (gfxinfo) | 1,792 | 1,793 |
| Janky frames (FrameTimeline), per run | 0, 2, 1, all the app's | 1, 0, 0, the app's |
| Frames presented at another vsync than expected, per run | 0, 53, 43 | **3, 0, 0** |
| `doFrame`s starting more than 2 ms late, per run (of which after main-thread work) | 21 (6), 34 (8), 29 (9) | **13 (2), 10 (0), 9 (0)** |
| Frame time p50 / p90 / p99 (gfxinfo) | **5** / 8 / 12 ms | 6 / **7** / **9** ms |
| Main thread per frame p50 / p90 / p99 | **1.31** / 3.18 / 8.00 ms (max 12.7) | 1.41 / **2.05** / **3.24** ms (max 5.6) |
| RenderThread per frame p50 / p90 / p99 | **2.60** / **3.60** / **5.14** ms | 3.04 / 4.62 / 6.60 ms |

**Main thread.**
- Compose's median main-thread frame is a little shorter. Its slowest are 2.5 times as long as compose-rs's.
- Its three janky frames were all the app's. Each composed and measured a newly revealed item inside the frame ("Where each app struggles").
- compose-rs prefetched 356 to 370 times a run: it composes, measures and records the next item between frames (D156, D322, D350), carousels included.

**compose-rs's one janky frame.** It was a 21.4 ms `DrawFrame` in its first run. 12.5 ms of it went to `CreateGraphicsPipeline` for a `CircularRRectOp`: Skia compiling a GPU pipeline the first time it drew that shape. HWUI stores compiled pipelines (`ShaderCache::store`), and no later run had one.

**RenderThread.** compose-rs's is slower at every percentile, for less work (below). As on the feed ([12](12-android-performance.md), "the RenderThread's boost"), that is the boost:

| HWUI boost (medians) | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Boost minimum, time-weighted (out of 1024) | 283 | 114 |
| Frames unboosted / at 100–199 / at 200 or more | 5 % / 19 % / 75 % | 49 % / 30 % / 25 % |
| `DrawFrame` p50: unboosted / 100–199 / 200 or more | 3.35 / 3.08 / 2.52 ms | 3.45 / 3.05 / 2.37 ms |
| RenderThread running time on the little cores | 4 % | 14 % |

At the same boost, the two RenderThreads' frames take the same time. Compose's long main-thread frames earn it a boost three quarters of the time; compose-rs's half its frames run unboosted.

### Stress animation: frames (10 s, 3 runs)

| | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Frames (FrameTimeline) | 1,198 | 1,200 |
| Janky frames (FrameTimeline), per run | 1, 0, 20, all the app's | **0, 0, 0** |
| Frames presented at another vsync than expected, per run | 925, 1,202, 1,164 | 1,199, 0, 1,206 |
| `doFrame`s starting more than 2 ms late, per run | 1, 7, 237 | 1, 2, 17 |
| Frame time p50 / p90 / p99 (gfxinfo) | 15 / 17 / 19 ms | 15 / 17 / 19 ms |
| Main thread per frame p50 / p90 / p99 | 3.68 / 5.07 / 7.18 ms (max 12.2) | **3.20** / **3.98** / **5.24** ms (max 8.6) |
| RenderThread per frame p50 / p90 / p99 | 7.52 / 8.84 / 10.49 ms | **6.16** / **7.20** / **8.60** ms |
| HWUI boost minimum, time-weighted; frames unboosted | 704; 0 % | 450; 0 % |

**Both apps run near their limit.** Both are boosted on every frame. Both RenderThreads take most of a 120 Hz vsync (8.33 ms) at p50, and more at p90 (Compose) or p99 (compose-rs).

**Compose's third run.**
- Its main thread started 237 `doFrame`s late (none after its own work: the scheduler woke it late) and missed 20 deadlines.
- Its main thread's p50 was 5.14 ms, against 3.59 and 3.68 ms in the other runs.
- Nothing in the trace explains it beyond more time waiting to run (24 against 5 ms runnable). It is the median run's jank that counts: 1 against 0.

#### With `ModulateAlpha` (D402)

A second session (`results/2026-10-23-pixel-8-pro-stress-modulate-alpha.json`, `stress_animation` only) measured both apps again. Kotlin's cells were given `compositingStrategy = CompositingStrategy.ModulateAlpha`, Compose's opt-in for fading a layer's drawings one by one without an offscreen buffer. compose-rs is unchanged.

| | Compose, `Auto` (first session) | Compose, `ModulateAlpha` | compose-rs (second session) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Janky frames, per run | 1, 0, 20 | 1, 1, 0 | 1, 1, 1 |
| Main thread p50 / p90 / p99 | 3.68 / 5.07 / 7.18 ms | 3.89 / 5.04 / 6.65 ms | 3.26 / 4.04 / 5.84 ms |
| RenderThread p50 / p90 / p99 | 7.52 / 8.84 / 10.49 ms | 6.22 / 7.03 / 8.21 ms | 6.36 / 7.42 / 9.28 ms |
| Main thread, RenderThread work | 2,897, 6,048 ms | 2,795, 3,286 ms | 2,134, 4,178 ms |

**With `ModulateAlpha`:**
- Compose's RenderThread does 46 % less work, a fifth less than compose-rs's, and its frames match compose-rs's.
- Its main thread keeps doing a third more work than compose-rs's.

**compose-rs's janky frames in this session** (one a run) were RenderThread frames of 12 to 16 ms, of which 9 to 14 ms was `Vulkan finish frame`: waiting for the GPU. This happened in the first session too, without missing a deadline (slowest `DrawFrame`s 11.2 to 15.4 ms).

So the stress animation janks rarely in either app, and which one depends on the session.

### Work

| Stress scroll (10 flings) | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Main thread work | 1,230 ms | **576 ms** (−53 %) |
| RenderThread work | 1,656 ms | **1,379 ms** (−17 %) |
| Main thread CPU time | 3.89 s | **3.29 s** |
| RenderThread CPU time | **4.90 s** | 5.82 s |

| Stress animation (10 s) | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Main thread work | 2,897 ms | **2,163 ms** (−25 %) |
| RenderThread work | 6,048 ms | **4,399 ms** (−27 %; Compose with `ModulateAlpha`: 3,286 ms) |
| Main thread CPU time | 4.27 s | **3.90 s** |
| RenderThread CPU time | 7.16 s | **5.66 s** |
| HWUI's worker threads (`hwuiTask0`, `hwuiTask1`), CPU time (the second run) | **8.7 s** | 10.9 s |

**Work** is milliseconds on the fastest core at its highest frequency ([12](12-android-performance.md), "Method"). compose-rs's main thread does about half Compose's work scrolling and three quarters in the animation.

**HWUI's two worker threads** run in the animation (scrolling, they hardly run), where both apps keep them busy most of the time. They rasterize the 50 stroked waves on the CPU into masks (Skia's software path renderer). That work is the canvas's, and it costs compose-rs a quarter more: its masks go into new GPU images each frame rather than recycled ones (next section).

### Memory

| | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| Stress list, PSS 5 s after start | 63.6 MB | **49.7 MB** |
| of which Java heap / native heap / code / graphics | 5.3 / 10.8 / 7.3 / 34.3 MB | 1.3 / 17.0 / 2.3 / 23.8 MB |
| Stress list, PSS after 10 flings | 110.8 MB | **97.9 MB** |
| of which Java heap / native heap / graphics | 12.1 / 21.8 / 63.3 MB | 6.5 / 21.0 / 62.4 MB |
| Stress animation, PSS 3 s after start | **166.9 MB** | 289.4 MB |
| of which Java heap / native heap / graphics | 12.3 / 21.8 / 119.4 MB | 7.8 / 59.6 / 210.8 MB |
| Stress animation, PSS after 13 s | **251.0 MB** | 405.4 MB |
| of which Java heap / native heap / graphics | 30.0 / 27.0 / 132.2 MB | 24.9 / 143.6 / 218.9 MB |

**On the list**, compose-rs holds less after start (less code, less Java heap, less graphics memory) and slightly less after scrolling. Both apps' graphics memory roughly doubles over the flings: the render thread's caches, and the 8 bitmaps' textures.

**In the animation, compose-rs holds 60 % more.** Over a minute of it (sampled at 5, 20, 40 and 60 s, outside measure.py) it moved between 320 and 450 MB: it doesn't leak, but it waits for the garbage collector. Compose stayed between 184 and 224 MB.

**Where it goes** (`dumpsys gfxinfo` after the minute):

- **GPU memory.** HWUI's GPU caches held 146.6 MB for compose-rs, of which 82.6 MB were Skia's software path masks (518 entries), against 103.7 MB and 8.0 MB (50 entries) for Compose.
  - A cached mask lives as long as its path.
  - Kotlin's one reset `Path` frees each wave's mask when it changes.
  - compose-rs's replayer makes a new `android.graphics.Path` for each path each frame, and drops it when the display list does. Its native path, and the mask cached for it, live until the collector finalizes the Kotlin object.
- **Native heap.** The 60 to 144 MB are those paths' native memory, waiting for the same collection. A `Path`'s native size isn't counted against the Java heap, so the collector runs late.
- **New GPU images.** Since the dead paths' masks keep their textures, Skia allocates 50 new GPU images a frame (`allocateImageMemory`: 50 a frame, 0.19 ms) where Compose re-uploads into textures it recycles.

The fix belongs to the Android bridge, outside this benchmark:

- the replayer could `rewind()` a dropped path's `android.graphics.Path`, or reuse it for the next definition, freeing its native memory and its mask at once;
- or compose-rs could keep a path's identity across frames, so that an unchanged wave isn't defined again.

### Startup

| | Kotlin Compose | compose-rs |
|---|---|---|
| `stress` (`TotalTime`, 15 cold starts) | 143 ms (134 to 155) | **126 ms** (117 to 138; −12 %) |
| The first frame's main thread (`traversal`, one traced start) | 64.3 ms | **44.4 ms** |
| `bindApplication` | 19.2 ms | **12.3 ms** |

**Compose's first frame:**
- `Compose:initializeView` 8.5 ms;
- a recomposition, 3.2 ms;
- a measure of 20.8 ms, which composes and measures the visible items;
- the window's relayout, 4.5 ms;
- drawing, 8.2 ms.

The rest is untraced: class loading and the interpreter.

**compose-rs's first frame:**
- 14.1 ms of its own (`compose-rs: frame`), most of it two rounds of composing and laying out again (10.8 and 1.7 ms). The outer list composes its items, then each carousel composes its tiles: compose-rs has no subcomposition ([11](11-status.md)).
- 3.9 ms of replay, which makes the bitmaps;
- 5.4 ms of `Record View#draw()`;
- 6.2 ms waiting for the RenderThread's first frame (`postAndWait`);
- 4.7 ms of window relayout.

## Where each app struggles

From the traces of the runs above: the slowest 1 % of each app's frames on each thread, pooled over the 3 runs, with the slices inside them averaged per frame (`slowest_frames` gives the slowest 5 of each run).

**Compose, scrolling, main thread** (54 frames of 8.0 ms or more, 9.4 ms on average):
- `AndroidOwner:measureAndLayout` takes 4.5 ms a frame: Compose composes and measures a newly revealed item inside the layout pass, nested `LazyRow` included (`TextStringSimpleNode::measure` 1.1 ms, `Compose:recompose` 0.9 ms).
- `Record View#draw()` takes 3.4 ms.
- `Recomposer:animation` (the fling's frame) takes 3.5 ms.
- These are the frames that miss: Compose prefetches between frames too, but an item it hasn't prefetched in time is composed in the frame that reveals it.

**compose-rs, scrolling, main thread** (54 frames of 3.2 ms or more, 4.0 ms on average):
- Its own frame takes 0.5 ms of that.
- The rest is waiting for the RenderThread to take the frame (`postAndWait`, 2.2 ms), input (0.4 ms) and the view system.
- Its slowest main-thread frames are the RenderThread's.

**Both, scrolling, RenderThread** (Compose 6.5 ms on average, compose-rs 7.6 ms):
- Most of each is `flush commands` (2.9 and 3.4 ms): Skia submitting to and waiting for the GPU, and `queueBuffer` (1.9 ms).
- compose-rs's slowest are mostly unboosted frames (above). Its single 21 ms frame compiled a pipeline.

**The animation, main thread, all frames** (per frame):
- **Compose** runs its 147 transitions' frame loops in `Recomposer:animation` (1.19 ms). It measures and lays out (0.86 ms: the ticker and the percentages' text, 3.75 paragraphs a frame, 0.6 ms) and records (1.63 ms).
- **compose-rs** runs its 568 tasks (`compose-rs: tasks`, 1.12 ms: a task per animated value, and the ticker's), then lays out (0.40 ms, of which text 0.32 ms), draws (0.31 ms) and replays (0.68 ms). That comes to 2.03 ms for its whole frame, plus `Record View#draw()`.
- **Their slowest 1 %** (Compose 8.9 ms on average, compose-rs 7.0 ms) mostly wait for the RenderThread (`postAndWait`: 5.6 and 2.6 ms). compose-rs's also have 1.7 ms of tasks.

**The animation, RenderThread, all frames** (per frame):
- **Compose:**
  - Its `Drawing` takes 7.3 ms, of which `flush layers` takes 1.4 ms: 132 `alpha caused saveLayer` a frame, and 73 render passes (`OpsTask`s) a frame instead of one. Each cell faded below 1 is drawn offscreen and then composited.
  - This is the 46 % of RenderThread work that `ModulateAlpha` saves.
- **compose-rs:**
  - Its `Drawing` takes 6.0 ms, in one render pass.
  - 4.8 ms of it is `flush commands`, waiting for the GPU (Compose: 4.0 ms), which the 50 new mask images a frame add to.
- **Both apps' slowest RenderThread frames** (Compose 11.6 ms, compose-rs 9.8 ms on average) are those GPU waits: `Vulkan finish frame`, 4.3 and 7.4 ms.

**In short:**
- **Compose struggles on the main thread when content arrives.** Its slowest scroll frames compose and measure new items, and its animation frames are dearer per animated value.
- **compose-rs struggles where it hands drawing to Android:**
  - its paths, new every frame, cost memory, mask rasterization and GPU allocations;
  - its RenderThread runs unboosted because its main thread is short;
  - like Compose, it waits for the GPU on the heaviest frames.

## Next steps

- **Paths in the bridge** (the largest gap these screens show):
  - free or reuse a dropped path's `android.graphics.Path` in the replayer, so its native memory and its GPU mask go at once;
  - or let a `Canvas` keep a path's identity across frames;
  - then measure `stress_animation`'s memory and HWUI's worker threads again.
- **Infinite transitions** run a task per value (567 here; 1.1 ms of tasks a frame). A transition ticking its values in one frame callback, as Compose's does, would cut that.
- **Shader warm-up**: a pipeline compiled on first use cost compose-rs its one janky scroll frame. Compose's apps share the same cache behavior; it isn't specific to compose-rs, but it showed here.
